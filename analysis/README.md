# AntiparticleDM - analysis

Files for generating plots from the data in the `results` folder. Requires `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` for processing and plotting the results.

**Run `GeneratePlots.sh` to (re-)generate all the plots from the paper.**

### Plotting scripts

- `PlotContours_row.py`: Plot contours of discrimination significance for a given experimental ensemble.
- `PlotContours_analytic.py`: Plot analytic estimate of discrepancy between Dirac and Majorana cross sections.
- `PlotExposure.py`: Plot discrimination significance as a function of exposure for Ensembles A and D.
- `PlotGridPoints.py `: Plot an illustration of the numbering of the grid points used in the plane (f, lambda_p/lambda_n).
