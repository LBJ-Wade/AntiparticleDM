# AntiparticleDM - results

Results generated using the scripts in the `calc` folder.

The results folder have the format `AP_ExptX_YY` where `X` is the experimental ensemble (`A`, `B`, `C` or `D`) and `YY` is the DM mass in GeV. Within each folder, the results are labeled by an index specifying the point in DM-coupling parameter space under consideration.

Folder names post-fixed with `_exposure` are for a fixed point in DM-coupling parameter space, with the exposure of the 3rd and 4th experiments being varied.
